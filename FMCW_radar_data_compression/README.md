# FMCW radar data compression

Our project focuses on compressing FMCW radar data by exploiting the stationary nature of the analyzed signal. Indeed, the output of such systems is a linear combination of multiple sinusoidal signals and therefore it is by its nature a strongly periodic signal. For this reason, we first apply **Linear Predictive Coding** to reduce the dynamic of the signal and then, we use **Huffman coding** to further shrink the output file and improve the overall compression ratio. This folder contains the slideshow `.pdf` and the corresponding `.tex` source. Inside the code folder are stored all the files used to generate the presented results.
